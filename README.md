# Python-Heisman-Predictor
This is a program that can predict a year's potential Heisman winner/s or strong candidates for the NCAA College Football Heisman Award. Based on certain stats from a csv file downloaded from https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/, it will read the file and determine the criteria based on how well each player has done. To hit the 'potential Heisman winner' line, the total score of the desired columns must meet the 1500 threshold for it. To hit the 'strong candidate for this years Heisman', the total score must meet the 1000 threshold for it. Otherwise, it prints out that the player needs to improve their stats to be considered in the other two categories. 

For this one it comes from: https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2023-passing.html. You can get other statistics if you like but just change out the csv files and update the total score method as you go along
